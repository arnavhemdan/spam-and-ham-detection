Spam and Ham Detection using Bag of Words and Naive Bayes
This repository demonstrates how to build a simple spam and ham (non-spam) email classifier using the Bag of Words model and the Naive Bayes classification algorithm. The goal is to detect whether an email is spam or ham based on its content.

Overview
This project uses a Bag of Words (BoW) approach to convert email text into a numerical format, which is then used as input for a Naive Bayes classifier. The classifier will predict whether the given email is spam or ham (non-spam).

Technologies Used
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Numpy
Jupyter Notebook (optional)
Installation
Follow these steps to set up the environment and run the project:

Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/arnavhemdan/spam-ham-detection.git

Navigate to the project folder:
bash
Copy
cd spam-ham-detection
Create a virtual environment (optional, but recommended):
bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:
On Windows:
bash
Copy
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy
source venv/bin/activate
Install the necessary dependencies:
bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare the dataset (CSV or text file) containing emails. The dataset should have two columns: one for the email content and the other for the label (Spam or Ham).

Train the Naive Bayes classifier using the following command:

bash
Copy
python train_model.py
Once the model is trained, use it to predict new emails:
bash
Copy
python predict_email.py "Sample email content here"
Dataset
For this example, we use the SMS Spam Collection Dataset which contains a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham. You can also use your own dataset as long as it follows the structure of one column for content and another for labels.

Model Implementation
Bag of Words
The Bag of Words (BoW) model is used to convert the text content of emails into numerical data by tokenizing the text and representing it as a vector of word frequencies. This allows the classifier to learn patterns based on word occurrences.

Naive Bayes Classifier
The Naive Bayes algorithm is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem. It assumes that the features (words in this case) are conditionally independent, which makes it particularly suitable for text classification tasks like spam detection.

In this project, the Naive Bayes model is trained using Scikit-learn's MultinomialNB, which is ideal for text classification problems.

Results
After training the Naive Bayes classifier, the model's accuracy is evaluated using a test set. The classifier's performance can be visualized through confusion matrices and classification reports, which will show precision, recall, and F1 score.

Additional Notes:
You might need to add the actual implementation files (like train_model.py, predict_email.py, and requirements.txt if you plan on sharing the repo).
You can replace placeholder links (like in the "Dataset" section) with actual relevant ones or point to your dataset source.
